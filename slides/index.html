            This workshop is about building websites and we start by asking about your reasons for attending this workshop.
            Then, we talk about Jekyll and review the installation process.
            After installing Jekyll on your local machine, you have a few choices to build your first website. 
            We go over these choices and use one of them to build a website and explain the directory structure 
            in Jekyll. We talk about themes, Liquid language, layouts and includes and briefly introduce CSS.
            Then, we talk about blogging in Jekyll and plugins that extend Jekyll built-in capabilities. 
            Finally, we learn about serving the website online using GitHub or other web hosting services.

        <aside class="notes">
            Jekyll is a popular website generator based on Ruby, which is designed to build static websites. Jekyll is developed by Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll is fully integrated with GitHub and can be hosted for free on GitHub Pages. 
            Jekyll takes a template directory and runs it through two converters, Textile and Liquid. The result is a complete static website, a bunch of HTML and CSS files, ready to be served.

        <h2>Static vs Dynamic</h2>
        <aside class="notes">
            Website generators are divided into two categories: Dynamic and Static. Static pages are pre-rendered, cached, and delivered to the user via a content delivery network (CDN). On the other hand, Dynamic pages are generated in real time when the user sends the request.
            Static websites are easier for the web browser to load and are great choices for personal blogs, academic websites, or simple business websites. They eliminate the complexity of creating and working with databases and do not have any unnecessary overhead.
            To use static website generators, you are generally expected to use code-editors to build your website. Also, knowing a bit of CSS and HTML can help you to customize a theme for your website.

        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
            Static website are great options for publishing exactly all stored content to all users. Most of the static website generators use a templating language to build the layout of the
            website. Also, they use a lightweight markup language to support the creators write any contents without any special software or online tool.

        <aside class="notes">
            If you only want to try Jekyll, you do not need to install it on your system. You can fork Jekyll now on GitHub and change some configuration to serve your website on GitHub pages. 
            You can even use GitHub GUI to write blog posts. This is all covered in the introduction to Jekyll workshop.
            However, you cannot go further. Each tiny change needs to be committed on GitHub to show up in your website and you need to wait several minutes for GitHub to compile your codes
            and update the website. Thus, you need to install Jekyll locally to accelerate development.

        <p style="font-size:60%;"> You can still learn about Jekyll structure and tools without a running version on your system. </p>
        <aside class="notes">
            To install Jekyll on your system, first, you need to install two other programs. Jekyll is written in Ruby, an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Therefore, you need to install it to run Jekyll and maintain your Jekyll website. Another program is RubyGems, which is a package manager for the Ruby programming language.

        <aside class="notes">
            If you compare the files in Jekyll Now built on your local machine with the GitHub version, you will find that a few directories are missing.
            Its because new version of Jekyll now uses bundler to wrap the theme in the Gemfile. If you open Gemfile, you will find that a theme called 
            Minima is used in Jekyll Now

        <h2>What is a Gemfile?</h2>
        <p style="font-size:70%;">A Gemfile is used for describing gem dependencies for Ruby programs</p>
        <p style="font-size:70%;">Gems are used to distribute functionalities</p>

        <br>
        <p style="font-size:80%;">If you have a Gemfile, you need to install bundler and ask bundler to serve Jekyll when you change the Gemfile</p>
        <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
            $ gem install bundler
            $ bundle exec jekyll serve

        <p style="font-size:60%;"></p>
        <aside class="notes">
            If you have a Gemfile in the directory of the theme you found, you need to use Bundler to install all the gems before serving the website. Jekyll bundler is a gem that ensures compatibility of all the plugins across different environments with Jekyll installed on your system. You need to install Bundler after installing Jekyll:
            Jekyll monitors the project folder and rebuilds your website anytime you make a change. If you want to stop serving your website locally, use Ctrl + C.
            Instead of creating a new website using jekyll new, you can also clone a theme developed by community and use it as an star to your local machine and serve it there. We will learn more about that in Themes.

            You can clone or fork the themes available on GitHub. For other themes, you need to download and unzip them on your local machine. Then, serve it using Jekyll. Remember that you need to install the gems used by third-party themes before serving them by running bundle exec jekyll serve the first time you serve them on your local machine.
            If you are interested to use themes other than [Minima], Hyde is a simple, two-column, and uncomplicated theme. We will use this theme for the rest of this workshop to demonstrate different tools and capabilities of Jekyll.

            The biggest difference between site generators is the tools and capabilities they offer to write, publish, and monitor your content in the desired style. Jekyll has a standard structure to find the content of your website and display them properly. The information here is from official Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). A basic Jekyll website usually has the following directory structure:

            _config.yml stores configuration data of your site including the site’s title, logo, description, admin’s email and much more. You can also specify information such as Twitter handler and Google Analytics code and later recall them dynamically in other site pages.

            _data can be populated with well-formatted data files (such as YAML .yml files) and access later in the site.data variable. For example, you can write your resume here and regularly update it.

            _drafts is where you can keep draft posts. These posts follow the same format as your published posts. When they are ready to be published, you can easily drag and drop them into _posts folder.

            _includes contains reusable content that can be mixed and matched by your layout and posts, such as the footer and header of your site.

            _layouts are templates that wrap your website’s posts. You can build different templates for different parts of your website. In the layouts, you can specify the position of your content and the look of the webpage.

            _posts contains all of your posts usually in Markdown format. You can customize the permanent link for each post but is retrieved from the name of the files by default. The naming convention of these files is important and must follow the format: YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md.

            _sass includes .sass files, an extension of CSS files, used to format the layout of webpages. These files are later processed into main.css and define the style of your site, such as the size, type, and colour of fonts in each webpage.

            _site is the directory that contains all the files generated by Jekyll. You should not add any files to this directory or delete them from it. You also do not need to sync this directory on GitHub. If you are serving your website on other hosts, you only need to copy the files in this folder to the webserver and you are done. Any files such as CSS, JS, and images will also end up here in an assets folder.

            .jekyll-cache and .jekyll-metadata are hidden folders that contain a cache of the generated pages for faster serving and keeps track of the files created by Jekyll and the one that has been modified since the site was last built. You do not need to modify these files or sync them on GitHub.

            404.html is the HTML file that will be shown when they are directed to a page on your site that does not exist.

            Gemfile and Gemfile.lock stores all of the gem dependencies for your site.

            index.html or index.md is the default landing page of your site.

            .gitignore contains instructions for your source control system to ignore files/folders. You need to add the following addresses to gitignore:

        Markdown is a markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. There are different Markdown flavours with different capabilities but the main syntax remains unchanged. [Markdown Cheatsheet] gives you a quick reference to the most useful Markdown feature. Here, we review some of them:

        <h2>HTML & CSS</h2>
        <p style="font-size:80%;">Two of the core technologies for building webpages</p>
        <ul style="font-size:70%;">
            <li>HTML describes the structure of a web page using elements, e.g. </li>
                <pre><code> <h1 class="page-title">{{ page.title }}</h1> </code></pre>
            <li>CSS describes the presentation of web pages e.g.</li>
            <pre><code> 
              h1 {
                font-size: 36px;
              }
              </code></pre>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-size:80%;">CSS files are commonly stored in <b>_sass</b> folder in Jekyll directory</p>
        <p style="font-size:80%;">You can also add other folders, such as <b>assets</b> to Jekyll directory to organize your files</p>
    <aside class="notes">
        Unless you are building a new theme, you do not need to know CSS
        You need to know basic HTML elements to add or remove elements from a webpage. You can start by searching the skeleton of Jekyll theme to find the right elements.

        <h2>Activity 2</h2>
        <ul style="font-size:80%;">
            <li>Open <b>_posts</b> directory in Hyde or Jekyll Now</li>
            <li>Write a new post by following these steps:</li>
                <ul style="font-size:70%;">
                    <li>Duplicate an old post</li>
                    <li>Rename the duplicated file (change dates and name of the file)</li>
                    <li>Change the title of your new post</li>
                    <li>Use Markdown to write the body of your new post (try adding links and images)</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <img class="r-frame" src="./figures/posts.png"/ height="250"/>
    <aside class="notes">
        The _posts folder is embedded in Jekyll to contain the blog posts of your site. The best practice is to use Markdown to write pages but you can also use HTML. The beginning of each post should include proper Front matter to show Jekyll that the .md file should be processed as a new post. A valid post name must be in the format [year]-[month]-[day]-[post-name].md

        <h2>Liquid</h2>
        <p style="font-size:90%;">Liquid is an open-source template language created by Shopify and written in Ruby.</p>
        <br>
        <ul style="font-size:90%;">
            <li>Liquid Objects</li>
            <li>Liquid Tags</li>
            <li>Liquid Filters</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
            Front matter is part of a templating language called Liquid. Jekyll uses Liquid templating language to process your site’s pages. Liquid follows simple templating rules and helps you to add logic or supplemental content to your simple HTML or Markdown pages. To use Liquid in HTML or Markdown pages, you need to add “Front matter” notation.
        </aside>
    </section> 

    <section>
        <h2>Liquid Objects</h2>
        <p style="font-size:80%;"> Objects contain the content that Liquid displays on a page.</p>
        <p style="font-size:80%;"> To output content into a page, two curly braces are used e.g. </p>
        <br>

        <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>{{ page.title }} </code></pre>

        <pre>

Introduction
        </pre>
        <aside class="notes">
            In this case, Liquid is rendering the content of the title property of the page object, which contains the text Introduction.
        </aside>
    </section> 

    <section>
        <h2>Liquid Tags</h2>
        <p style="font-size:80%;">Tags create the logic and control flow for templates.</p>
        <p style="font-size:80%;">To perform logic statements or run a loop, curly braces are used with a percentage sign on each side e.g. </p>  
        
        <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
        {% if user %}
            Hello {{ user.name }}!

        <h2>Front Matter</h2>
        <p style="font-size:60%;"> 
            It guides Jekyll to parse your Markdown files and put content in the right place
            Use YAML format wrapped between triple-dashed lines.
            Open any of the files in _posts folder
        </p>

        <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
            ---
            layout: post
            title: Blogging Like a Hacker
            ---
        </code></pre>

        <p style="font-size:60%;"> 
           Now open page.html in the _layout folder:
        </p>

        <pre><code>
            ---
            layout: default
            ---
            <div class="page">
            <h1 class="page-title">{{ page.title }}</h1>
                {{ content }}
            </div>
        </code></pre>

        <aside class="notes">
            Front matter contains information about your webpage. Front matter must take the format of valid YAML or JSON wrapped between triple-dashed lines. When Jekyll finds this information in your files, it processes them differently. The front matter must be the first thing in your file.

            <h2>Layouts</h2>

            </div>
            <p style="font-size:70%;"> Jekyll later fills each section with the content of Markdown files, following the instructions of Front matter.</p>
        <aside class="notes">
            When browsing a website, many sections stay the same across multiple pages. Layouts in Jekyll give you an easy solution to build an HTML file and use it across your website. You have seen one of them just in the previous section.
        </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Layouts</h2>
            <p style="font-size:70%;">Open <b>default.html</b> in <b>_layouts</b> directory:</p>
            <pre>
                <img src="./figures/layouts.png" alt="Layout example" height="391" width="387"/>
            </pre>
            <p style="font-size:70%;">Later, we will learn how to ask Jekyll to put Markdown content in this layout.</p>
        <aside class="notes">        
            The file starts with tags that declare the type and language of the file. Here, we are not using Front matter since the file is not inheriting any other layout. The "head" tag is replaced with an include file. We learn more about them in the next section. In the "body" tag, the sidebar is created by another include file. The content will be replaced after interpreting the .md files.
        </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Includes</h2>
            <p style="font-size:80%;">Reusable components - Snippets of code that we want to use over multiple pages, such as:</p>
            <ul style="font-size:80%;">
                <li>Google analytics tags</li>
                <li>Headers and Footers</li>
                <li>Media Frames</li>
                <li>Sidebars</li>
                <li>Comment systems</li>
            </ul>

        <aside class="notes">
            Includes let you to use all reusable components in a directory and use Jekyll tags to import the components as needed. 
            Jekyll includes are helpful for putting social media tags, google analytics tags, headers and footers, media frams, sidebars and much more.
        </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Includes</h2>
            <p style="font-size:60%;">Let's look at the content of <b>head.html</b> in <b>_includes</b>:</p>
            <pre>
                <img src="./figures/includes.png" alt="Include example" height="500"/>
            </pre>

        <aside class="notes">
            The content of this file replaces the head section of all HTML files in Hyde. In the title section, you can find a conditional statement that changes the value in title tag based on your location on the website.
        </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Includes</h2>
            <p style="font-size:80%;">Includes can be used in other web pages via Liquid tags: </p>
            <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
                {% include head.html %}
            </code></pre>
            <br>
            <p style="font-size:80%;">We can also pass parameters to include: </p>
            <pre style="font-size: 13px"><code>
<div class="spacing youtube">
    <iframe width="400" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/{{ include.youtube_id }}"
    
    frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
            </code></pre>

            <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
                {% include youtube.html youtube_id="xtMBD1P3tz0" %}
            </code></pre>

        <aside class="notes">
            We can easily put includes in the Markdown or HTML files via liquid tags. Also, we can pass parameters to includes. This is useful when you have created a frame for showing the content 
            but you want to change the content based on the location in your website.
        </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <p style="font-size:80%;">Jekyll creates variables and assigns values to them by looking at 3 locations:</p>
            <ul style="font-size:80%;">
                <li><b>_config.yml</b></li>
                <li>files in <b>_data</b> directory</li>
                <li><b>Front matter</b> of Markdown files</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <table style="font-size:70%;">
                <tr> 
                    <td><b>_config.yml</b></td>
                    <td>files in <b>_posts</b> directory</td>
                </tr>
                <tr> 
                    <td>site.title, site.url</td>
                    <td>page.title, page.date</td>
                </tr>
              </table>
              <p style="font-size:60%;">The title in the file name will be stored in <b>.title</b> of <b>site.posts</b> object while the title in the Front matter of the post is stored in <b>page.title</b>.</p>

        <aside class="notes">
            When Jekyll processes your site, it looks for data in the Front matter, _config.yml, and _data files to assign values to variables. The data in the Front matter of each page will be stored in page global variable while data in _config.yml is stored in site global variable.

            Web hosting is the storage location where the content of your website is placed. You can use domain registrar to buy a domain and these companies usually sell the domain and host together as a bundle. Since Jekyll is a static website generator
