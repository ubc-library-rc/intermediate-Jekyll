# Build and customize a website with Jekyll

## Note: this workshop is in development and not yet complete.

This workshop will guide you to use Jekyll, a powerful static website generator, to build a website on your local machine and serve it on Github pages. In this workshop, we go beyond the material presented in the [Introduction to Jekyll](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/intro-jekyll/) workshop and explore templates and styles to customize your website using themes, Liquid templating language, and plugins.

The material of this workshop complements the previous [Introduction to Jekyll](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/intro-jekyll/) workshop. Thus, we are not going to cover the basics of hosting a website, choosing a site generator, and Git and Github. 

## Learning objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:
1. recognize the impact of building a personal academic website on academic reputation and networking
2. plan and build a Jekyll environment hosted on a local machine
3. modify your website using online templates and Jekyll templating language
4. differentiate domains and hosts and use free web hosts and domains to serve the website

## Before the workshop

+ Review the material [Introduction to Jekyll](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/intro-jekyll/) workshop. Particularly, read [Concepts and Terms](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/intro-jekyll/concepts/) and [What is Jekyll](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/intro-jekyll/jekyll/).

+ A [Github](https://github.com/) account. We will use Github Pages to host our static site. If you are interested in using a different domain name and connecting it with your Github Pages, please read this article.

+ Basic familiarity with Git and Github. Please see this workshop to learn the basics: [Introduction to Git and Github](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/intro-git/)
