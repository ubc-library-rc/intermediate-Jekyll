# Plugins

Jekyll plugins extend the capabilities of Jekyll. The following plugins are most popular:

[Jekyll-schoar](https://github.com/i nukshuk/jekyll-scholar) is for the academic blogger to format the bibliographies and reading lists for the web. 


[Jekyll Picture Tag](https://github.com/rbuchberger/jekyll_picture_tag) automates the process of making your figures across all different browsers and devices.


[Jekyll Feed plugin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed) generates an RSS-like feer of your Jekyll posts.

[Jekyll Sitemap Generator Plugin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap) silently generates a sitemaps.org compliant sitemap for your Jekyll site.

[Jekyll-admin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-admin) provides users with a traditional CMS-style graphical interface to author content and administer Jekyll sites.

Jekyll does not support commenting but you can use comment systems such as [Staticman](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman) or networked community platforms such as [Disqus]https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717053-what-is-disqus).

Plugins can be installed by adding a new array with the key `plugins` and the values of the gem names of the plugins. Also, make a `_plugins` directory and place the files of plugins here. Any file ending in `.rb` inside this directory will be loaded before Jekyll generates your site. Then, install your plugins using `gem install plugin_name`.

Jekyll has a [Guide to Plugins](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/) and you can find many more plugins in the [Awesome (Gem-Packaged) Jekyll Plugins](https://github.com/planetjekyll/awesome-jekyll-plugins).
