# Build your first website

You can build a new boilerplate website with a default gem-based theme by navigating to somewhere you would like to create your first project and running:

Input
{: .label .label-green }
```sh
$ jekyll new [name of blog]
```

The command above creates a new folder with the name of your blog in the current directory, which is populated with default content, such as an About page.

In order to view your website in a browser, you need to serve it with Jekyll. Jekyll will go through the files and compile them. To serve the simple website created above, run:

Input
{: .label .label-green }
```sh
$ jekyll serve
```

Jekyll will start a website on the local host `http://127.0.0.1` and port `4000`. You can view your first website by opening this address on your browser:

```bash
$ http://127.0.0.1:4000
```

Instead of creating a new website using `jekyll new`, you can also clone a starting point to your local machine and serve it there. We will learn more about that in [Themes]({{site.baseurl}}/04-1.Themes.html).

If you have a `Gemfile` in the directory of the theme you found, you need to use Bundler to install all the gems before serving the website. Jekyll bundler is a gem that ensures compatibility of  all the plugins across different environments with Jekyll installed on your system. You need to install Bundler after installing Jekyll:

Input
{: .label .label-green }
```sh
$ gem install bundler
```

Then, run the following command to serve the website:

 Input
{: .label .label-green }
```sh
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Jekyll monitors the project folder and rebuilds your website anytime you make a change. If you want to stop serving your website locally, use `Ctrl + C`.
