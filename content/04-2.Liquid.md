# Liquid 

Jekyll uses the [Liquid templating language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) to process your site's pages. Liquid follows simple templating rules and helps you to add logic or supplemental content to your simple HTML or Markdown pages. To use Liquid in HTML or Markdown pages, you need to add "Front matter" notation.

Jekyll support both Liquid Tags and Filters. You can find the list of all Liquid tags and filters in the [Liquid Documentation](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/variable/).

## Liquid Tags

Generally in Liquid, there are two types of tags:
- To output content into a page, two curly braces e.g. {% raw %} `{{ variable }}` {% endraw %} are used
- To perform logic statements or run a loop, curly braces are used with a percentage sign on each side e.g. {% raw %} `{% if statement %}` {% endraw %}

An `if/elsif/else` statement in liquid looks like this:

{% raw %}
```markdown
{% if page.title == 'Session 1' %}
  The page title is Session 1.
{% elsif page.url == 'Session 2' %}
  The page title is Session 2.
{% else %}
  The page title is not known.
{% endif %}
```
{% endraw %}

A for loop in Liquid looks like this:

{% raw %}
```markdown
{% for post in site.posts %}
  {{post.title}}
{% endfor %}
```
{% endraw %}

You can also assign variables on your pages:

{% raw %}
```markdown
{% assign myVariable = "foo"; %}
```
{% endraw %}

## Liquid Filters

You can use filters to change strings or manipulate a list of items. To use filters, you should separate the content with a `|` sign from the filter keyword. For example, the following line counts the number of characters in the string and shows it on your webpage.

{% raw %}
```html
{{ "How many characters are in this string?" | size }}
```
{% endraw %}

For more Liquid examples, take a look at this [Github gist](https://gist.github.com/JJediny/a466eed62cee30ad45e2).

## Front matter

Front matter contains information about your webpage. Front matter must take the format of valid `YAML` or `JSON` wrapped between triple-dashed lines.  When Jekyll finds this information in your files, it processes them differently. The front matter must be the first thing in your file.


```markdown
---
layout: post
title: Blogging Like a Hacker
---
```

`YAML` and `JSON` files use `key:value` notation. You can also add comments in YAML files with a `#` sign. 
{: .note}

Front matter mainly specifies the layout of the page and its location on your website but it can also include custom page variables that youâ€™ve created and can be later accessed with "dot notation", such as `page.title`. 

You can build a permanent link using the data provided in Front matter or include tags and categories that can be processed later by Jekyll to create lists of tags. To find the regular variables in Jekyll, look at [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/Front matter/). These variables can be expanded by other variables you need to save and later recall from that webpage.

If you open [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) and look at the code in `page.html` in the `_layout` folder, you will find examples of Front matter and Liquid tags:

{% raw %}
```markdown
---
layout: default
---

<div class="page">
  <h1 class="page-title">{{ page.title }}</h1>
  {{ content }}
</div>
```
{% endraw %}

At the top of the file, Front matter is wrapped in triple hyphens. Here, we are specifying that this file should be processed as the content of `default.html`, which contains the website's header and footer. 

{% raw %} `{{ page.title }}` {% endraw %} and {% raw %} `{{ content }}` {% endraw %} are Liquid tags and output the title of the page and its content that are retrieved from the Markdown files.

## Layouts

When browsing a website, many sections stay the same across multiple pages. Layouts in Jekyll give you an easy solution to build an HTML file and use it across your website. You have seen one of them just in the previous section.

`page.html` was one of the layouts of [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde). Layouts specify the general structure of web pages, which are then populated with data from Markdown files and includes. A simple website only needs two layout files: one for blog posts `post.html` and one for static pages `page.html`. A personal academic website might have layouts for a CV or "about me" page. A default layout helps you to put a header, a footer, and all common elements of web pages in a single file.

Now, lets open `default.html`:

{% raw %}
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-us">

  {% include head.html %}

  <body>

    {% include sidebar.html %}

    <div class="content container">
      {{ content }}
    </div>

  </body>
</html>
```
{% endraw %}

The file starts with tags that declare the type and language of the file. Here, we are not using Front matter since the file is not inheriting any other layout. The `<head>` tag is replaced with an **include** file. We learn more about them in the next section. In the `<body>` tag, the sidebar is created by another **include** file. The content will be replaced after interpreting the `.md` files.

## Includes

While layouts specify the skeleton of web pages, includes are snippets of code that we want to use over multiple pages. Google analytics tags or social media forms are some examples. You can also wrap headers and footers of your website as include components.

Includes are stored in the `_include` folder. You can find two HTML files in the `_include` folder of [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde). Lets look at the content of `head.html` here:

{% raw  %}
```html
<head>
  <link href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/11" rel="profile">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">

  <!-- Enable responsiveness on mobile devices-->
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1">

  <title>
    {% if page.title == "Home" %}
      {{ site.title }} &middot; {{ site.tagline }}
    {% else %}
      {{ page.title }} &middot; {{ site.title }}
    {% endif %}
  </title>

  <!-- CSS -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ site.baseurl }}public/css/poole.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ site.baseurl }}public/css/syntax.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ site.baseurl }}public/css/hyde.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=PT+Sans:400,400italic,700|Abril+Fatface">

  <!-- Icons -->
  <link rel="apple-touch-icon-precomposed" sizes="144x144" href="{{ site.baseurl }}public/apple-touch-icon-144-precomposed.png">
                                 <link rel="shortcut icon" href="{{ site.baseurl }}public/favicon.ico">

  <!-- RSS -->
  <link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="RSS" href="/atom.xml">
</head>
```
{% endraw %}

The content of this file replaces the `<head>` section of all HTML files in [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde). In the `<title>` section, you can find a conditional statement that changes the value in `<title>` tag based on your location on the website.

Includes can be used in other web pages via Liquid tags:

{% raw  %}
```html
{% include head.html %}
```
{% endraw %}

## Variables

When Jekyll processes your site, it looks for data in the Front matter, `_config.yml`, and `_data` files to assign values to variables. The data in the Front matter of each page will be stored in `page` global variable while data in `_config.yml` is stored in `site` global variable.

For example, `site.title` is retrieved from the `_config.yml` file and store the title of your website, shown on the tab on your browser, but `page.title` is retrieved from each page's Front matter. A simple website generally uses `site` and `page` variables. You can find all variables in your disposal [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/).

You can also create your own variables by defining them in the front matter or `_config.yml` and later using them in Liquid statements.

Take a look at the `_config.yml` in the root directory of [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde). You can find a series of `key:value` that either set properties of Jekyll, such as the Markdown interpreter, or are later called to be used in different web pages, such as `site.description` or `site.url`.

You can add supplemental data, much like a database or API, in Jekyll by building other YAML files and putting them in a `_data` folder in the root directory of Jekyll. 

For example, if the name of the YAML file is `students.yml`, we can simply access them by putting {% raw %}`{{site.data.students}}` {% endraw %} in the HTML or Markdown page. You can use Liquid tags and filters, such as `for` loops, to navigate data and process them before putting them on your website.
